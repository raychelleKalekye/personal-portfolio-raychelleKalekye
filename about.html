  <h2>About Me</h2>
  
  <p>
    My name is Kalekye Raychelle, and I come from Mombasa, Kenya. I am currently pursuing 
    a degree in Computer Science and Informatics, where I specialize in artificial intelligence, 
    distributed systems, and data science. My academic journey has given me a strong 
    foundation in both theory and practical application of modern technologies.
  </p>
  
  <p>
    I have developed skills in programming languages such as Python, JavaScript, and Java. 
    I also work with frameworks and libraries like React, Flask, and TensorFlow. 
    Additionally, I have hands-on experience in databases (MySQL, MongoDB), 
    cloud services, and version control systems like Git and GitHub.
  </p>
  
  <p>
    Beyond technology, I am passionate about problem-solving, research, and building 
    solutions that have a real-world impact. In my free time, I enjoy reading, exploring 
    new tech tools, and engaging in creative design. My long-term career goal is to 
    become a leading AI researcher and innovator, contributing to advancements that 
    improve access to knowledge and opportunities.
